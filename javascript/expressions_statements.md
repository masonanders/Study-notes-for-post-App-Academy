# Expressions vs Statements

## Expression
In JavaScript, an expression is something that produces a value. An expression should always end with a semicolon.

## Statement
A statement is something that performs an action. `if` and `while` are two examples of something that does not produce a value (not to be mistaken with returning a value).
